# Causal inference in environmental and social science

The course is an interdisciplinary third-cycle course offered by the [Department of Political Science](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/) and financed by the two-year graduate research school [ClimBEco – Climate Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a changing world](https://www.cec.lu.se/education/postgraduate-studies/climbeco).

## 1. Learning Outcomes
Participants will be able to accomplish the following objectives by the end of the course:

-	understand theoretical frameworks in causal inference and appropriately apply them to case studies.
-	apply quantitative causal inference methods in R and critically assess the estimates in terms causal inference
-	analyse and evaluate the quality and robustness of causal inference approaches
-	design a causal inference research project with a selection of a reliable methodology.

## 2. Course Content

In socio-ecological systems, there are many types of human interventions. Some aim for environmental protection and nature conservation. Yet only few things humans do with the environment are systematically designed, such that we can easily infer the effects of such measures. Unintended consequences may occur, and the outcomes may not be planned either. Observational data is thus often noisy. We may have multiple causes and interactions of factors at once. We can nevertheless use these messy real-world observations to learn something about the (socio-ecological) consequences of human actions in the environment.
This course gives an overview of statistical techniques that are employed in social and environmental sciences to estimate causal effects of interventions such as targeted (environmental) policies from observations. The course starts from gold-standard techniques for controlled experiments and develops an understanding of alternative techniques for settings where experimentation is not feasible or morally justifiable. The course will consist of theoretical lectures and applied showcases in R, replicating seminal studies in lab sessions.

Based on different concepts and theories of causal inference, the course seeks to provide Ph.D. students from different disciplines with an understanding of the current state of quantitative causal inference. The main modules of the course are:

-	Module 1: The gold-standard – experiments, incl. a note on causality, randomized-controlled trials;
-	Module 2: (Semi) Natural Experiments, incl. difference-in-differences, panel data estimations, and staggered treatment;
-	Module 3: Simulated counterfactuals, incl. matching methods and synthetic control groups;
-	Module 4: Instrumental variables and regression discontinuities
-	Module 5: An outlook into structural equation models, Bayesian inference, and machine learning techniques

Each of the modules above will contain a lecture on the state-of-the-art and a seminar with applied replications of seminal papers in environmental policy evaluation. In the seminars students will also have to (collaboratively) solve causal inference problems. Moreover, students will, after the end of the course, write a short research project report of a causal inference project of their own choice to help them to apply causal inference techniques in their own field of Ph.D. research.

## 3. Teaching and Assessment
The course will consist of 10 sessions that will all take place in one week, including five interactive seminars where students engage in group work and coding exercises.

The course is particularly designed to be accessible for students from very different backgrounds, including different social and natural science disciplines. Therefore, the introduction of different traditions of causal inference will include some elementary aspects. Students with a more advanced statistical background will nonetheless benefit from the application of statistical concepts and methods in a setting of causal inference.
Evaluation will take place on the basis of participation and a short final project report of about 30hrs workload to be submitted about 3-4 weeks after the end of the course. In the project, participants will apply the presented methodologies to their own field of research or to an equivalent issue of their choice.

Re-examination is offered after the conclusion of the course. If necessary, a second opportunity for re-examination will be arranged at a later date.

## 4. Grades
The grades awarded are Pass or Fail. To be awarded a Pass the student must fulfill the learning outcomes specified and demonstrate an independent, reflective, and critical approach to the research field and to the methods presented in the course. Replicable data and code must be provided (except for cases with confidentiality issues where toy data can be accepted).
